    <h1 class="aboutme">Hi, my name is Ashley!</h1>
    <p class="aboutme"> I'm a born and raised New Yorker who, fueled by my love of tailgating and warm weather, moved to Texas seven years ago to attend UT Austin. 
    At UT, I studied classical archaeology and history. After graduating, I decided to work in education as a substitute teacher 
    which eventually led to me moving to Houston and becoming a first grade teacher. While I loved the students that I was lucky to teach,
    I realized that education was not my ideal career choice and decided to change careers which has led me to enroll in DigitalCrafts. 
    In my spare time I enjoy doing pilates, making failed attempts at Samin Nosrat recipes, and binge watching Forensic Files.
    As for family, I have a husband named Clayton and a pet <a target= "_blank" href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bichon-frise/">Bichon</a> named Sir Baxter Cuddlesworth that we treat more like a human infant than a dog.</p>
